# AWS-Based POS System

## 1. Project Description

### 1.1 Project Name

**AWS-Based POS System**

### 1.2 Description

The **AWS-Based POS System** is a modern, scalable, and feature-rich Point of Sale solution designed to streamline sales, inventory management, and customer transactions for businesses of all sizes. The system is built to run in a cloud-based environment using AWS services, offering robust performance, security, and scalability.

This system allows users to manage products, process transactions with various payment methods (credit/debit cards, cash, and digital wallets), and generate real-time reports. It provides user authentication and role-based access control, enabling businesses to assign different levels of access (Admin, Cashier, Manager).

The POS system is integrated with popular third-party services like Google Calendar for task scheduling, Slack for notifications, and Trello for task management, making it easy to track important business operations and deadlines. The system also provides real-time updates of inventory and sales, ensuring business owners can monitor and manage their operations effectively.

### Key Features:
- **User Authentication and Role-Based Access**: Admins, cashiers, and managers have different access levels to the system.
- **Inventory Management**: Add, update, and remove products from the inventory, track stock levels, and monitor product sales.
- **Sales Processing**: Process customer payments through multiple methods including credit cards, digital wallets, and cash.
- **Real-Time Analytics and Reports**: View detailed sales reports, generate insights, and track inventory performance.
- **Third-Party Integration**: Integration with Google Calendar, Slack, and Trello for seamless communication and task management.
- **Cloud-Hosted**: The system is hosted on AWS for enhanced scalability and availability.

By leveraging AWS, this system can handle high volumes of transactions, ensure security for sensitive customer data, and scale as your business grows. The application is built with a focus on user-friendliness and speed, providing businesses with the tools they need to optimize their sales process and improve operational efficiency.

## 7. Implementation Plan

### 7.1 Small Feature Implementation

For the first demonstration, we have implemented **CRUD Operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for **Inventory Management**.

**Feature**: Users can add new products, edit existing products, view product details, and delete products.

**API Endpoints**:

- `/api/products` → Create a new product.
- `/api/products/{id}` → Get product details by ID.
- `/api/products/{id}` → Update an existing product.
- `/api/products/{id}` → Delete a product.

### 7.2 Deployment Plan

- **Codebase**: Hosted on GitHub for version control.
- **CI/CD**: Set up for automated deployment through GitHub Actions.
- **Hosting**: Deployed on **AWS EC2** with **PostgreSQL** as the primary database and **MongoDB** for logs.

## 8. Next Steps

- Implement **Sales Processing** with payment gateway integration.
- Implement **Reporting** and **Analytics** (Sales, Inventory).
- Integrate with **Google Calendar** and **Slack** for task and notification management.
